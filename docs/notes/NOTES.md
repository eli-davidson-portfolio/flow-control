# Flow Control Project Notes

## Strategic Overview

### Project Structure
1. **Core Layer** (Nearly Complete)
   - Platform detection (OS, shell)
   - Docker environment management
   - Progress/feedback system
   - Recovery mechanisms

2. **Test Layer** (In Progress)
   - Visual tests (L0) - UI/feedback
   - Platform tests (L1) - OS/shell
   - Environment tests (L2) - Docker/system
   - Operation tests (L3) - Coming soon

3. **Deployment Layer** (Planned)
   - Development environment
   - Production environment
   - Local testing environment
   - Clean deployment

### Current Benefits
1. **Platform Independence**
   - Works on macOS/Linux seamlessly
   - Handles Docker Desktop vs daemon
   - Consistent paths and commands

2. **Robustness**
   - Auto-recovery from failures
   - Clear error messages
   - Progress feedback
   - State validation

3. **Maintainability**
   - Well-structured code
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Clear dependency chain
   - Documented behaviors

### Future CLI/TUI Plans

#### Proposed Structure
```
flow
├── env
│   ├── status    # Show environment status
│   ├── up        # Start environment
│   ├── down      # Stop environment
│   └── switch    # Switch environments
├── deploy
│   ├── dev       # Deploy development
│   ├── prod      # Deploy production
│   └── local     # Deploy locally
└── test
    ├── all       # Run all tests
    ├── visual    # Run visual tests
    ├── platform  # Run platform tests
    └── env       # Run environment tests
```

#### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1** (Current Focus)
   - Complete test framework
   - Get all tests passing
   - Implement deployment
   - Document everything

2. **Phase 2** (Future)
   - Basic CLI wrapper
   - Essential commands
   - Simple interface
   - Maintain make targets

3. **Phase 3** (Future Enhancement)
   - Interactive features
   - TUI elements
   - Advanced operations
   - User customization

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# Current (Make-based):
make deploy-dev
make test

# Future (CLI/TUI):
flow deploy dev
flow test all

# Or interactive:
flow
> Select environment: [dev] prod local
> Action: [deploy] test status
> Starting deployment...
```

## Current Status (2023-12-03)

### Progress Update (2023-12-04)
1. **Test Framework**
   - L0 (Visual) tests implemented and running
   - L1 (Platform) tests passing
   - L2 (Environment) tests created and in progress
   - Make-based test runner working reliably
   - Shell compatibility (zsh/bash) resolved

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Makefile system with smart executable detection
   - Progress feedback system operational
   - Docker detection and management improved
   - Test isolation and recovery in place

3. **Next Steps**
   - Complete L2 test implementation
   - Begin L3 (Operation) test design
   - Enhance visual feedback system
   - Progress toward deployment phase
