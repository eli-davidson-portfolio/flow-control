   - Converted `demoUI.txt` to `docs/notes/demo-ui-requirements.md`
   - Created `docs/api/` and `docs/architecture/` directories

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Update CI/CD pipelines if necessary

## Verification Steps

1. **Build System**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make dev
   ```

2. **Test Suite**

   make test
   ```

3. **Development Flow**
   ```bash
   make verify-dev
   make dev
   ```
